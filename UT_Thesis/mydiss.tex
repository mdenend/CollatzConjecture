I want to give a huge thank you to both of my advisors for this project: Scott Aaronson and Marijn Heule. \par
Scott Aaronson came to UT Austin from MIT in fall 2016. I knew that I wanted to write a Master's Thesis from pretty much the time I started my Master's Degree, and I heard he might be a great person to work with. We come from very different backgrounds. He is well-renowned for his work in Theoretical Quantum Computing. I came into UT's CS program with virtually no Math/CS theory background, as my undergrad degree was in Electrical Engineering. At one point, he suggested that I talk to Marijn Heule, and hence, this project was born. I got a chance to witness firsthand the enthusiasm that Scott has for CS and Math theory, and it's no wonder that Scott has done so much work in Theoretical Computer Science... he just keeps going and going! This entire project would not have been possible without him and he is as much, if not more, of an author of this Thesis as I am. I'm also deeply thankful to him for his support as I had to go through the challenge of losing my mom.\par
Marijn Heule became an Assistant Research Professor at UT in fall 2017. He was a Research Scientist at UT Austin when I first met him. Marijn is a master at SAT Solving, and is famous for his proof of the Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem that was the largest proof ever at the time at 100 TB. Much like Scott, Marijn has a great deal of enthusiasm for mathematical problems. This entire project is originally Marijn's idea, so I am thankful that he had this idea, and I am very happy to have written a Thesis with such a cool topic. Without his advice and direction and his many read-overs and edits, this Thesis would have not been possible to finish, so he is as much, if not more, of an author of this Thesis as I am. I am also deeply thankful of the support he gave me as I had to go through the challenge of losing my mom.\par
When Scott and Marijn first met each other, they raced each other to solve several proofs related to this project: Scott by hand, Marijn using computation. I happened to be in the middle of it all, unable to keep up with the blazing speed of these two brilliant minds. It took me some time but I can now confidently read through these original thoughts that Scott and Marijn had and understand most of them much better now then when they first occurred. \par
I am forever indebted to these two men and can only hope to someday achieve the greatness and brilliance of them. \par
I am also thankful for the many friends that I have made along the way towards finishing this Thesis, especially those who gave me support as I had to deal with the loss of my mom. There are far too many to list, but you know who you are. From my time here in Austin, I have made many friends that I want to keep for many years to come.

The Collatz Conjecture (also known as the $3x+1$ problem) is simple to explain, yet proving that all positive integers following the Collatz map must converge to 1 has eluded mathematicians for over half a century. Aaronson and Heule are exploring solving the Collatz Conjecture using an approach involving string rewrite systems: Aaronson transformed the Conjecture into a string rewrite system and Heule applied parallel SAT solvers on instances of this system. Similar approaches have been applied successfully to other mathematical problems.\par
We started looking into simpler, but also challenging variants of the conjecture. This thesis defines some of these variants and investigates easily provable as well as very hard variants. We study the hardness of unsolved variants by computing the number of rewrite steps needed up to 1 billion. Our hardness prediction method suggests that proving termination of the challenging variants should be considerably easier compared to solving the original conjecture.

Matthew Alexander Denend was born in Spokane, Washington. He received the Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering, cum laude, from The University of Washington, Seattle, in 2012. He worked as a Packet Core Performance and Handset Engineer at T-Mobile in Bellevue, Washington for 3 years. He decided to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science degree, and after he was accepted to The University of Texas at Austin in 2015, he left his job at T-Mobile to move to Austin, Texas and became a full-time student.
