abstract="A rewriting system can be shown terminating by an order-preserving mapping into a well-founded domain. We present an instance of this scheme for string rewriting where the domain is a set of square matrices of natural numbers, equipped with a well-founded ordering that is not total. The coefficients of the matrices can be found via a transformation to a boolean satisfiability problem. The matrix method also supports relative termination, thus it fits with the dependency pair method as well. Our implementation is able to automatically solve hard termination problems.",

abstract="We present a new method for automatically proving termination of term rewriting. It is based on the well-known idea of interpretation of terms where every rewrite step causes a decrease, but instead of the usual natural numbers we use vectors of natural numbers, ordered by a particular non-total well-founded ordering. Function symbols are interpreted by linear mappings represented by matrices. This method allows to prove termination and relative termination. A modification of the latter in which strict steps are only allowed at the top, turns out to be helpful in combination with the dependency pair transformation.",

abstract="Satisfiability (SAT) is considered as one of the most important core technologies in formal verification and related areas. Even though there is steady progress in improving practical SAT solving, there are limits on scalability of SAT solvers. We address this issue and present a new approach, called cube-and-conquer, targeted at reducing solving time on hard instances. This two-phase approach partitions a problem into many thousands (or millions) of cubes using lookahead techniques. Afterwards, a conflict-driven solver tackles the problem, using the cubes to guide the search. On several hard competition benchmarks, our hybrid approach outperforms both lookahead and conflict-driven solvers. Moreover, because cube-and-conquer is natural to parallelize, it is a competitive alternative for solving SAT problems in parallel.",
