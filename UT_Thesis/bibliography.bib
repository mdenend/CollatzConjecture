abstract="A rewriting system can be shown terminating by an order-preserving mapping into a well-founded domain. We present an instance of this scheme for string rewriting where the domain is a set of square matrices of natural numbers, equipped with a well-founded ordering that is not total. The coefficients of the matrices can be found via a transformation to a boolean satisfiability problem. The matrix method also supports relative termination, thus it fits with the dependency pair method as well. Our implementation is able to automatically solve hard termination problems.",

abstract="We present a new method for automatically proving termination of term rewriting. It is based on the well-known idea of interpretation of terms where every rewrite step causes a decrease, but instead of the usual natural numbers we use vectors of natural numbers, ordered by a particular non-total well-founded ordering. Function symbols are interpreted by linear mappings represented by matrices. This method allows to prove termination and relative termination. A modification of the latter in which strict steps are only allowed at the top, turns out to be helpful in combination with the dependency pair transformation.",

For this system, we have developed and implemented efficient algorithms based on classical simplification orders, dependency pairs, and the size-change principle. In particular, it contains many new improvements of the dependency pair approach that make automated termination proving more powerful and efficient. In ProVE, termination proofs can be performed with a user-friendly graphical interface and the system is currently among the most powerful termination provers available.",
