1%Moving relevant comments to where they belong.

%MARIJN: Use the word Variant instead of Subproblem throughout the Thesis. Use variances and instances of algorithm 4 instead.
    %THOUGHT: When do I use instance, and when do I use instances?
    

%First half of algorithm 4 references Algorithm 4, Second half does not referring to algorithm 4. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'LL HAVE TO KEEP A TRACK OF THROUGHOUT THE PAPER.

%I should make sure that all ColMod second inputs are sets. That's not the case from the base 4 side of things.

%CONTINUING FROM HERE!
%WORKING ON LEMMA 3.4, A CORRECT WAY. I HAVE AN INTERESTING IDEA. I SEEM TO NOTICE THAT A PATTERN OF $\frac{3^{V_o}}{2^{V_e}}(n+j)-j$ is possible after $V_o$ odd steps and $V_e$ even steps for some j. Why needs to be thought more, but if I can turn any initial number into this fractional form, then I can argue that when $\frac{3^{V_o}}{2^{V_e}}$ happens in one cycle, n gets smaller. Going to let this simmer for a while, and work on other portions of the proof.

%IT SEEMS TO WORK. WHY???? This doesn't seem obvious to me at ALL. I'm just going to go ahead and write the proof in for now...

%I wrote in Scott's proof, but am not convinced that $\frac{9}{8}^k(x+20)-20$ is how we can express $k$ run throughs of the cycle. It just isn't mathematically clicking for me... I'm going to sleep over this and look at it again tomorrow.

%Chapter 4 references the $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 4$ cycle (allowing $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6$, make sure my text for this analysis is consistent.

%CHAPTER 4 ONWARDS
%Replace the gnuplots with the correct text. Rerun these. 

%4.3.1: (1,5, and 7 (mod 8)): Variants. Have it all tie back to Algorithm 4. pp. 15-16. Make it uniform.

%IF I HAVE TIME: Look at Variant 5 chains in binary, and see if there's anything in common here.

%Section on the odd rules: odd number to odd number: take a look at it soon NEED THIS! (Going to argue with Marijn that I don't think this is a significant decrease in the steps. Want his thoughts.)

%section 9.4 Single SRR removal: Not sure what I wanted to do here, and explain the bullet points. What do I want here? Not clear. HERE, I think I really need to try and figure out what conclusion do I want to draw given the data. Does the hardness measure really make much sense???


%Citations: Years are missing, place those in there. Remove the URL DLL for Sil99: Don't need them. Need them for ArXiV.
%CITATIONS FOR THIS UT_FORMAT ARE NOT SHOWING UP. I think it may be because we're using the much older format for things, perhaps. I should probably just go ahead and send the paper, saying that I realized this today and I'm going to investigate why URLs aren't showing up at all. I think it has to do with the dissertation template that I'm using. I may have to get things format checked too.

%Removed margin notes that are still relevant:

%\marginnote{I think an appendix with the table results would at least be a good idea. Printing all the  sequences would be overkill.}

%(REGARDING ZANTEMA'S OTHER PROBLEM, AND WHY IT SHOULD BE EASY:)\marginnote{I'm unsure of whether I should go into more detail for this section.} (I think I should, if I have time.)

%(REGARDING THE PROVING OF THE COLLATZ CONJECTURE SRS NOT WORKING, AND MATRIX INTERPRETATION EXAMPLE): \marginnote{Should I follow the example from the Grant Proposal?} Probably not at this point.
