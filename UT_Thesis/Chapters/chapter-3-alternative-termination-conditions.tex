\chapter{Alternative Termination Conditions} \label{sec:alttercdns}
 This chapter explores the possible variants of Algorithm~\ref{alg:ColSP}. Before we investigate them, we define a graph paradigm that transforms the $3x+1$ problem into directed graphs that depict the flow for all input numbers modulo base $b$, where $b$ is a power of 2. Using this paradigm, we can show that some variants are easily provable. However, others are not.
\section{Defining a Collatz Base \textit{b} Graph} \label{subsec:colgraph}
Define $G_b=(V,E)$ to be a ``Collatz Base $b$ Graph'', where $b = 2^k$, and $k$ is nonnegative. Choosing a power of 2 for $b$ allows us to easily reason with binary numbers, which is useful for both several proofs in this chapter and the String Rewrite System that we will discuss starting in chapter~\ref{sec:SRSandSAT}. $V$ has $b$ vertices in it, where each vertex is labeled a unique integer in the interval $[0, b-1]$. Vertex $v \in V$ corresponds to $v \Mod{b}$. This paper uses the term ``node $v$'' as shorthand to correspond to the number $v$ in $v \Mod{b}$, as opposed to ``vertex $v$'' which corresponds to the actual vertex of the graph. Let $x_i$ be the $i$\textsuperscript{th} step of the $3x+1$ sequence for input number $x$, and $x_{i+1}$ be the step after. $E = V \times V$ is a set of directed edges, where, for nodes $u, v \in V$, $(u,v) \in E$ if and only if $x_i \equiv u \Mod{b}$ and $x_{i+1} \equiv v \Mod{b}$ for some $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$. \par

\section{Lemmas that hold for any base \textit{b} Collatz Graph}
This section contains some lemmas that are used throughout this Thesis. First, we start with a lemma about the number of node transitions in any Collatz Base $b$ Graph $G_b= (V,E)$.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:numOutEdges}
Given a Collatz Base $b$ Graph, for all $v \in V$, if node $v$ is even, then the vertex $v$ has two outgoing edges. Otherwise, if node $v$ is odd, then the vertex $v$ has only one outgoing edge.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Take a number $x_i$ that corresponds to node $v$. First, let us consider the case where node $v$ is even. When we divide by 2, we just remove the lowest 0. The new bit at index $k-1$ can be either a 0 or a 1, allowing for two options for even nodes. \par
Now, take $x_i$ that corresponds to a node $v$ that is odd. Multiplying $x_i$ by 3 and adding 1 will make the binary string grow at least one bit longer (since $3\cdot x_i = 2 \cdot x_i + x_i$), giving us only one option for the least significant $k$ bits, meaning $x_{i+1}$ can only correspond to one node $w \in V$, and only one such outgoing edge from $v$ exists.
\end{proof}
Now, we have a couple of important properties about cycles that exist in any Collatz Base $b$ Graph, and the fact that these cycles cannot continue indefinitely. First, we introduce the ``0 cycle'' Lemma.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:zeroCycle}
For any Collatz Base $b$ Graph (where $b$ is a positive power of 2), a self-loop occurs on a 0 node. This cycle cannot continue indefinitely.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Assume we have an input number $N$ such that $N \equiv 0 \Mod{b}$. This means that the $k$ least significant bits are all 0. Apply the $3x+1$ mapping once to this string. We remove a 0 from the end, since we divide the input number by 2. We now look at the new number $N/2$ and the $k$ least significant bits. The $k-1$ least significant bits are all 0. But what is the value of the bit in the most significant of the $k$ bits? If it is a 0, then our new number $N/2 \equiv 0 \Mod{b}$, and we have a self-loop. \par
To show that the self loop cannot continue indefinitely: every time we follow the self-loop, remove a 0. Since we also know that $N > 1$ in order for the algorithm to continue running, we also know that at least one binary digit is a 1. So as we continue dividing by 2 and removing 0 bits, we eventually reach a point where the least $k$ significant bits are $1000\ldots 0$, meaning we transition to node $b/2$ instead, ending the cycle.
\end{proof}
Now, we introduce another important lemma about cycles: the fact that we will always have a cycle between nodes $b-2$ and $b-1$. We call this the ``1 Consumption'' Lemma.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:oneConsumption}
 For any Collatz Base $b$ Graph, a cycle between exists between nodes $b-2$ and $b-1$. This cycle cannot continue indefinitely.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
In this proof, we will show first that a $b-1 \rightarrow b-2 \rightarrow b-1$ cycle exists, and second, that this cycle cannot continue indefinitely; more precisely, that some number congruent modulo to $b-2 \Mod{b}$, after division by 2, actually becomes $b/2-1 \Mod{b}$ instead. We will do so using long multiplication in binary, adding the 1 in as well for shorthand. \par
Let $x$ be a arbitrary number congruent modulo to $b-1 \Mod{b}$. We want to express $x$ in binary, so let $x$ have $m$ bits. We know that since $x$ is congruent modulo to $b-1 \Mod{b}$, all bits from indices 0 to $k-1$ are 1. Let $x_j$ denote the $j$\textsuperscript{th} bit of $x$, $k \leq j \leq m$. These indices correspond to unknown bits. Let $1_{+1}$ correspond to the adding of 1 after multiplying by 3, which is added to the 0\textsuperscript{th} index of $x$. Let $c_j$ denote the unknown carry for the $j$\textsuperscript{th} index of bits being added. Let $y$ be the result after $3x+1$ is computed, and let the $j$\textsuperscript{th} index of $y$ be the same index as $x$. The multiplication is referenced in Figure~\ref{fig:mul}. \par
\begin{figure}

\end{tabular}
\caption{The long multiplication corresponding to $3x + 1$. Note how, in the addition step, the $1_{+1}$ is in place of a zero, and the addition is just $x + 2x + 1$.}
\label{fig:mul}
\end{figure}
Observe that, in binary, multiplication of a binary number $x$ by 3 is just $x + 2x$, and $2x$ is just placing all bits of $x$ one index to the left. In the multiplication we show in Figure~\ref{fig:mul}, we replace the extra 0 vacated by $2x$ with the addition of 1, $1_{+1}$, allowing us to perform $3x+1$ with just one addition instead of two. \par
Observe that all bits in the resulting binary number $y$ from indices 0 to $k-1$ are 1, except for index 0, which is 0. This is because all bits of $y$, save index 0, are computed by adding $1+1$ and carrying over the 1 from the previous addition. As a result, $y$ is congruent modulo to $b-2 \Mod{b}$, meaning an edge from node $b-1 \Mod{b}$ to node $b-2 \Mod{b}$ exists in our graph.\par
When we divide $y$ by 2, we just remove the lowest 0 from $y$. Hence, bit $y_k$ is now in position $k-1$. If $y_k$ is 1, our number is now congruent modulo to $b-1 \Mod{b}$. This means an edge also exists from node $b-2 \Mod{b}$ to node $b-1 \Mod{b}$, proving the existence of the cycle. \par
Now we show that this $b-2 \rightarrow b-1 \rightarrow b-2$ cycle will always eventually terminate. This happens when, after dividing a number congruent modulo to $b-2 \Mod{b}$ by 2, bit $y_{k-1}$ is 0. So we need to show this eventually occurs for any arbitrary $x$. There are two cases for this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Some bit in $x$ is 0. Let $x_j$ be the least significant bit of $x$ that is 0 (all bits which have indices lower than $j$ are 1). Look back at Figure~\ref{fig:mul}, and replace $x_j = 0$, and have all bits at indices less than $j$ be 1. After taking the $3x+1$ step, all indices of $y$ between 1 and $j-1$ will be 1, as each time, we add $1 + 1$ and carry over a 1. However, when we get to index $i$, we add $1 + 0$ plus a carry of 1, making bit $y_j = 0$. Since after we divide by 2 we move all bits one index to the right, bit $y_j$ now moves to index $j-1$. We repeat this process a total of $j-k+1$ steps. After this, the 0 bit will be in position $y_{k-1}$, making $y$ congruent modulo to $b/2 - 1 \Mod{b}$ instead, breaking the cycle.
    \item No bit in $x$ is 0. In this case, again looking at Figure~\ref{fig:mul}, all bits in $y$ from indices 1 to $m$ will be 1. However, bit $y_{m+1}$ will be 0, as we carry over a 1, and add only one other 1, since bit $x_{m+1}$ is an implied 0. Since bit $y_{m+1} = 0$ we right shift it to index $m$ after dividing by 2. We then follow case 1, where $j = m$, and the cycle will also break in this case.
 \end{enumerate}
 Hence, no $b-2 \rightarrow b-1 \rightarrow b-2$ cycle for any legal value of $b = 2^k$ can have an indefinite cycle. 
\end{proof}
We introduce one more lemma that shows that cycles where the magnitude of divisions by 2 outweigh the magnitude of multiplications by 3. We call this the ``Even Node Dominance Lemma''.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:EvenDom}
Given a cycle in any Collatz Base $b$ Graph $G$, let $v_{e}$ be the number of even nodes in the cycle, and $v_{o}$ be the number of odd nodes. If $2^{|V_e|} > 3^{|V_o|}$, then the cycle cannot continue indefinitely.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $2^{|V_e|} > 3^{|V_o|}$, and let $x$ be the number at some point in the cycle. Run through the cycle once, back to the same vertex that we started at with $x$. We visited $|V_e|$ vertices in the cycle, so we divided $x$ by $2^{|V_e|}$ after one trip around the cycle. We also visited $|V_o|$ vertices in the cycle, so each time we multiplied $x$ by 3, and overall, multiplied $x$ by about $3^{|V_o|}$. (We also added one to $x$, but this is asymptotically insignificant compared to multiplying by 3 or dividing by 2, so ignored in this proof.)\par
So after we visited the cycle once, we computed a number approximately equal to $\frac{3^{|V_o|}}{2^{|V_e|}}x$. Since $2^{|V_e|} > 3^{|V_o|}$, $\frac{3^{|V_o|}}{2^{|V_e|}}x < x$. Therefore, one of two things must happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x$ eventually becomes 1, which means the cycle no longer can be repeated.
\item The cycle is eventually broken.
\end{enumerate}
In both cases, the cycle cannot continue indefinitely.
\end{proof}
\section{Base 4 Graph and Variants} \label{subsec:base4graph}
In this section, we build a simple example of a Base 4 graph and show that we can prove $\ColMod{N}{A}{4}$ terminates for any nonempty $A \subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$. There are 4 different nodes: one for each integer between 0 and 3. Because $4 = 2^2$, we are looking at the last 2 bits of each number. For example, a number congruent modulo to $0\Mod{4}$ has 00 as the 2 least significant bits, while a number congruent modulo to $2\Mod{4}$ has 10 as its 2 least significant bits. 
 \subsection{Base 4 graph construction} \label{subsubsec:proofbase4graph}
Figure~\ref{fig:base_4_graph} shows the Base 4 Collatz Graph, and this subsection describes the construction of it. First, we will start with the even nodes, then the odd nodes:
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (A) at (0,2) {0};
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (B) at (2,2) {1};
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (C) at (0,0) {2};
    \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (D) at (2,0) {3};
    \path  (A) edge [loop above, thick] (A);
    \path [->] (B) edge [thick] (A);  
    \path [->] (A) edge [thick] (C);  
    \path [->] (C) edge [thick] (B);  
    \path [->] (C.30) edge [thick] (D.150);  
    \path [->] (D.210) edge [thick] (C.-30);  
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The Collatz Base $b$ Graph when $b = 4$. There are 4 nodes, each one corresponding to a value mod 4.}
    \label{fig:base_4_graph}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Node 0 corresponds to the number ending with binary string ``00''. Removing the last 0 leaves either ``00'', looping to $0\Mod{4}$, or ``10'', changing it to $2\Mod{4}$.
    \item Node 2 corresponds to the number ending with binary string ``10''. Removing the last 0 leaves either ``01'', changing it to $1\Mod{4}$, or ``11'', changing it to $3\Mod{4}$.
\end{itemize}
Now, the odd nodes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Node 1 corresponds to the number ending with binary string ``01''. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 1 results in the binary number ending in ``$y_200$'', where $y_2$ is an unknown bit. Even though we don't know $y_2$, the number is still $0\Mod{4}$.
    \item Node 3 corresponds to the number ending with binary string ``11''. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 1 results in the binary number ending in ``$y_3y_210$'', which is still $2\Mod{4}$.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Base 4 variants} \label{subsubsec:base4variants}
We introduced the Base 4 case for nodes because we can prove that we need to visit all of the nodes in this graph. This is equivalent to saying that each of the Collatz Variants, $\ColMod{N}{A}{4}$ terminates for nonempty $A \subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$, and for any input number $N$. 
\begin{theorem}
$\ColMod{N}{A}{4}$ terminates for nonempty $A \subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We will start with proving that $\ColMod{N}{\{2\}}{4}$ will terminate for any input number $N$, because the 2 node is central to the Base 4 graph.\par
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:collatzSubTwoModFour}
$\ColMod{N}{\{2\}}{4}$ terminates for any $N$.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
We use the graph to help in this proof. An equivalent question is this: Can we show that node 2 must be visited for all input numbers? To show that this is the case, we have to show that all other nodes must visit node 2. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2: If the input number is this, we are already done.
    \item 3: This must, by definition, transition after the $3x+1$ mapping has been applied in one step.
    \item 1 and 0: 1 must transition to 0 after applying the $3x+1$ mapping once. For 0, use Lemma~\ref{lem:zeroCycle} (the ``0 cycle'' lemma) for $b = 4$, and the number will eventually transition to the 2 node.
\end{itemize}
Since all other nodes must visit node 2, it means that for all $N$, $\ColMod{N}{\{2\}}{4}$ terminates.
\end{proof} \par

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:collatzSubOneModFour}
$\ColMod{N}{\{1\}}{4}$ terminates for any $N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We use Lemma~\ref{lem:collatzSubTwoModFour} to show that node 2 must be visited, and Lemma~\ref{lem:oneConsumption} to show that the cycle between nodes 2 and 3 cannot continue indefinitely, so node 2 must eventually transition to 1, proving termination of this variant.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:collatzSubZeroModFour}
$\ColMod{N}{\{0\}}{4}$ terminates for any $N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Given Lemma~\ref{lem:collatzSubOneModFour}, we know we must visit node 1, and given Lemma~\ref{lem:numOutEdges}, an odd node can only have one outgoing edge, so it must transition to node 0.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:collatzSubThreeModFour}
$\ColMod{N}{\{3\}}{4}$ terminates for any $N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Given the ``Even Node Dominance Lemma'',~\ref{lem:EvenDom}, the $2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 2$ cycle cannot continue forever because, if we assume that the 0 node never self-cycles, $2^2 > 3^1$. The 0 self-cycle makes even nodes dominate even more. So either $\ColMod{N}{\{3\}}{4}$ terminates by eventually becoming 1, or the cycle is broken, and the only other node to visit outside this cycle is node 3,  causing $\ColMod{N}{\{3\}}{4}$ to always terminate.
\end{proof}
Since all of these lemmas hold, it follows that any singleton set from $A \subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$ causes $\ColMod{N}{A}{4}$ to terminate. Also, by definition of Algorithm~\ref{alg:ColSP}, any larger size sets for $A$ also terminate as larger set sizes add more termination conditions. So any nonempty set $A$ will cause $\ColMod{N}{A}{4}$ to terminate for any input $N$.
\end{proof}
\section{Base 8 Graph and Variants} \label{subsec:base8graphsubpblms}
We showed that, using the Base 4 graph, $\ColMod{N}{A}{4}$ terminates for any nonempty base set $A$ and input number $N$. We decided to see what would happen if we expanded to $k = 3$ bits. We ran into a problem, and could not prove all variants of $\ColMod{N}{A}{8}$. This will motivate further computation undertaken in chapter~\ref{sec:subhrdnspred}, as we try to determine how hard figuring out these unproven variants are. \par
Figure~\ref{fig:base_8_graph} shows the base 8 graph.
\begin{figure}

    \caption{The Collatz Base $b$ Graph when $b = 8$. There are 8 nodes, each one corresponding to a value mod 8.}
    \label{fig:base_8_graph}
\end{figure}
There are 8 different nodes, since $8 = 2^3$, and we are looking at the last 3 bits of each number. 
\subsection{Base 8 graph construction} \label{subsubsec:base8proof}
Like the base 4 graph, let us show how to construct the base 8 graph. We examine the even nodes first. In this case, there are four different nodes: 0, 2, 4, and 6. Using Lemma~\ref{lem:numOutEdges}, each vertex has two different transitions, depending on what the next bit to the left of the 3 bits after removing the least significant 0. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Node 0 corresponds to the binary string ``000''. Removing the last 0 leaves either ``000'', looping to $0\Mod{8}$, or ``100'', changing it to $4\Mod{8}$.
    \item Node 2 corresponds to the binary string ``010''. Removing the last 0 leaves either ``001'', changing it to $1\Mod{8}$, or ``101'', changing it to $5\Mod{8}$.
    \item Node 4 corresponds to the binary string ``100''. Removing the last 0 leaves either ``010'', changing it to $2\Mod{8}$, or ``110'', changing it to $6\Mod{8}$.
    \item Node 6 corresponds to the binary string ``110''. Removing the last 0 leaves either ``011'', changing it to $3\Mod{8}$, or ``111'', changing it to $7\Mod{8}$.
\end{itemize}
Now, the odd nodes. Let $y_3$ and $y_4$ be unknown bits.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Node 1 corresponds to the binary string ``001''. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 1 results in the string ``100'', or $4\Mod{8}$.
    \item Node 3 corresponds to the binary string ``011''. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 1 results in the string ``$y_3010$'', which is $2\Mod{8}$.
    \item Node 5 corresponds to the binary string ``101''. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 1 results in the string ``$y_4y_3000$'', which is $0\Mod{8}$.
    \item Node 7 corresponds to the binary string ``111''. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 1 results in the string ``$y_4y_3110$'', which is $6\Mod{8}$.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cycle analysis} \label{subsubsec:cycleanalysis}
Since we do not have proofs for all Collatz Variants of base 8 with singleton $A$, we analyzed whether certain cycles can last indefinitely. Some of these analyses can be used in proving some Collatz Variants, whereas others that are unknown can be tied to variants we have not proven yet.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The 0 self-cycle, ($0  \rightarrow \ldots$) cannot continue forever, as per Lemma~\ref{lem:zeroCycle}.
    \item The $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6$ cycle cannot continue forever as per Lemma~\ref{lem:oneConsumption}.
    \item The $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$ cycle cannot continue forever, as even nodes dominate ($2^2 > 3$), so according to Lemma~\ref{lem:EvenDom}, this cycle cannot last forever.
    \item $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0  \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 4$ cycle:  Even nodes dominate, even without any 0 self-cycles ($2^3 > 3$), so according to Lemma~\ref{lem:EvenDom}, this cycle cannot continue forever.
    \item $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$ cycle: There are three different variations of this cycle. We have a proof for only one of them:
\begin{itemize}
  \item No transition allowed from $4 \rightarrow 2$: The following theorem explains this case.
  \begin{theorem} Aaronson '17: The $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$ cycle cannot continue indefinitely.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    If we start some number $x$ such that $x \equiv 4\Mod{8}$, and follow the $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$ cycle once, we turn $x$ into $(9x+20)/8 = \frac{9}{8}(x+20)-20$. If we were to repeat the cycle $k$ times, we would turn $x$ into $\frac{9}{8}^k(x+20)-20$. This quantity must be an integer for all $k$ if the cycle is to continue forever. However, $x+20$ will only have a finite number of factors of 8, so the cycle must terminate.
  \end{proof}
  \item Transition allowed between $4 \rightarrow 2$: This creates a conflict between two different cycles: one that causes growth by approximately a factor of $9/8$ ($4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$), and another that causes the cycle to decay by a factor of $4/3$ ($4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$). Even though we can prove that both of these cycles terminate independently, it has been a challenge to show that the combination of them cannot continue indefinitely, as we cannot prove that one cycle must stop transitioning to the other. Hence, no proof, by hand or machine, is known that we must break out of this combination of cycles, by visiting either node 5 or 7. Naturally, a proof that this cycle must be broken would prove termination of Collatz Variant $\{5,7\}$, which we explore in chapter~\ref{sec:subhrdnspred}.
  \item Building on the prior point, we can also consider visits to the node 7 as well in this cycle. This adds the $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6$ cycle to the already challenging two cycle case. Naturally, if we can't prove that the smaller combination of cycles $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$ and $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$ cannot terminate, it would be far more difficult to add a third cycle, even though all three cycles must terminate individually. A proof of this cycle would solve Collatz Variant 5, also explored in chapter~\ref{sec:subhrdnspred}.
\end{itemize}
\item $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 4$ cycle: There are three different variations to showing this cycle cannot continue forever: keeping both nodes 1 and 7 omitted, or omitting one node or the other. Adding in both nodes yields the entire base 8 graph. The variant where both 1 and 7 are omitted is proven, the other two are not.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Strictly following this cycle, no changes: assuming no zero-cycles, there are 4 distinct even nodes in this cycle, and 2 distinct odd nodes. $2^4 > 3^2$, so according to the ``Even Node Dominiance Lemma'',~\ref{lem:EvenDom}, this cycle cannot continue forever. The nodes that must be visited to break this cycle are either 1 or 7, so this is a proof that Collatz Variant $\{1,7\}$ terminates.
        \item Allowing 7 but avoiding 1: Like variant $\{5,7\}$, we have two conflicting cycles: the $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6$ cycle which cause the number to grow by approximately $\frac{3}{2}$ every time it takes this cycle, and the base cycle $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 4$ that reduces it by approximately $\frac{16}{9}$, depending on number of zero self cycles. These two cycles are interesting in that they clash the fastest growing part of the graph: the $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6$ cycle, and the fastest decaying part of the graph: the 0 self-cycle, followed by two more even numbers. We also are not aware of a proof for this case either. Such a proof that these two cycles cannot continue combined forever would be equivalent to proving terminaton of Collatz Variant 1. We present analysis of hardness of this cycle in chapter~\ref{sec:subhrdnspred}.
        \item Allowing 1 but avoiding 7: Adding back in 1 actually allows for three different cycles: $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 4$, $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$, and $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$.  Finding a proof for this case is expected to be harder than the unsolved two cycle case of $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$, and $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4$. Solving that the combination of these three cycles must terminate is equivalent to proving termination of Collatz Variant 7.

\subsection{Base 8 variants} \label{subsubsec:base8subprob}
As for which nodes we are forced to visit during the computation of a $3x+1$ sequence, we can prove these four following Collatz Variants 2, 3, 4 and 6 terminate. Variant 0 can be shown to terminate if another unproven variant terminates. It will still be mentioned here. The following will explain how these five variants terminate. We present them in an order to build arguments off of one another.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{6\}}{8}}$:} In the graph, not visiting node $6$, means the Collatz Sequence would have to traverse one of two cycles: $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$ or $4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 4$, both of which are cycles that cannot continue forever, because of the ``Even Node Dominance Lemma''. Even though some combinations of cycles are difficult to prove, these two are not: since both cycles decay, they must visit another node not in the cycle to cause growth. The only option is node 6. Hence, the combination of these two cycles cannot continue forever, and $\ColMod{N}{\{6\}}{8}$ must terminate.
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{3\}}{8}}$:} We know that $\ColMod{N}{\{6\}}{8}$ terminates, so as a result, we know that node 6 must be visited in our base 8 graph.  Given Lemma~\ref{lem:oneConsumption}, the $6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6$ cycle cannot continue forever. Hence, node 6 must transition to node 3 eventually, meaning $\ColMod{N}{\{3\}}{8}$ must terminate.
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{2\}}{8}}$:} Since we know that we must visit node 3, this transitions to node 2, proving $\ColMod{N}{\{2\}}{8}$ must terminate.
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{4\}}{8}}$:} Given that we know we need to visit node 2, we look at the graph and see two possible paths, both which lead to node 4: Either visit node 1 then 4, or visit node 5 then 0. From Lemma~\ref{lem:zeroCycle}, the 0 cycle cannot continue forever, so the path taken must traverse to node 4. Hence, $\ColMod{N}{\{4\}}{8}$ terminates.
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{0\}}{8}}$:} In the graph, we can see that to visit node 0, we must come from node 5. So we cannot prove this yet unless we prove termination for $\ColMod{N}{\{5\}}{8}$.
\end{itemize}
We do not have proofs for $\ColMod{N}{\{1\}}{8}$, $\ColMod{N}{\{5\}}{8}$, $\ColMod{N}{\{7\}}{8}$, but we can prove a couple of combined variants of them:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{1,5\}}{8}}$:} We already know that Collatz Variant 2 must terminate. Looking at the base 8 graph, 2 must traverse to either node 1 or 5. Clearly, $\ColMod{N}{\{1,5\}}{8}$ must terminate.
    \item \textbf{$\boldsymbol{\ColMod{N}{\{1,7\}}{8}}$:} This was discussed in the prior subsection, but repeated here: Since the $4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 4$ cannot continue forever, either node 1 or 7 must be visited. Hence, $\ColMod{N}{\{1,7\}}{8}$ must terminate.
\end{itemize}
However, the combination $\ColMod{N}{\{5,7\}}{8}$ has not been proven. Hence, we've run some computational experiments to try and better understand the difficulty of coming up with a proof for termination of these variants.
