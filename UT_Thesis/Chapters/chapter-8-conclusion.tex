\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this Thesis, we analyzed the Collatz Conjecture and simpler, yet still challenging variants, and propose a hardness prediction for determining the answers to these variants. We started by building a program that investigates Collatz Variants by running many $3x+1$ sequences for all odd numbers up to 1 billion, and seeing how many odd numbers occur in record breaking sequences that avoid the Collatz Variants. \par
We also investigated the Collatz SRS that Aaronson came up with in~\cite{HeuleAaronson} and that Heule tried to prove with Matrix Interpretation. Even though this methodology was not able to solve the Collatz Conjecture, we still think it has promise. We also built a simple program that ran the Collatz SRS and determine the hardness for variants, finding out that the hardness varies more than in the algebraic case.\par
As described in ~\cite{HeuleAaronson}, we believe this approach for trying to solve the Collatz Conjecture, as well as Collatz Variants, has merit and needs further investigation, so we hope to continue to do so in the future.
