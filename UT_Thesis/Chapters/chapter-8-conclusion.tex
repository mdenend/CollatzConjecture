\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this thesis, we analyzed the Collatz Conjecture and simpler, yet still challenging variants, and propose a hardness prediction for determining the answers to these variants. We started by building a program that investigates Collatz Variants by running many $3x+1$ sequences for all odd numbers up to 1 billion, and seeing how many odd numbers occur in record breaking sequences that avoid terminating the Collatz Variants. \par
We also investigated the Collatz SRS that Aaronson created and that Heule tried to prove with matrix interpretation. Even though this methodology has been unable to solve the Collatz Conjecture so far, we think it still has promise. We also built a simple program that ran the Collatz SRS and determined the hardness for subproblems, finding out that the hardness varies more than in the algebraic case.\par
As described in ~\cite{HeuleAaronson}, we believe this approach for trying to solve the Collatz Conjecture, as well as Collatz Variants, has merit and needs further investigation. We plan to do so under the recently approved grant.
