\chapter{Definitions} \label{sec:defns}
We will use the following terms throughout the paper to talk about the $3x+1$ problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\boldsymbol{3x+1}$\textbf{ mapping}: A one step application of $Col(N)$ to some input number $N$.
    \item $\boldsymbol{3x+1}$\textbf{ sequence}: Define this as follows: 
    \begin{align*}
        x_0 = x &= \text{ initial input number} \\
        x_{i+1} &= \begin{cases} 
        x_{i}/2 &\text{ if $x_i$ is even} \\
        3 x_{i} + 1 &\text{ if $x_i$ is odd} \\
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    This sequence can continue for arbitrarily large values of $i$, but we are only interested in following the sequence until $x_i$ for some $i$ is 1, as any value after 1 follows the $1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$ cycle indefinitely.
    \item \textbf{Collatz Variant:} When we say ``Collatz Variant,'' we use Algorithm~\ref{alg:ColSP}, which was defined in the introduction. The shorthand for this will be $\ColMod{N}{A}{b}$, where $A = \{a_1 \ldots a_s\}$ is all of the bases that cause termination of the algorithm. Note that for all $a \in A$, $0 \le a < b$, and $A = \emptyset$ is the same as Algorithm~\ref{alg:ColR}.
    \item \textbf{Collatz Variant a:} The vast majority of our analyis is when $b = 8$, so when we say Collatz Variant a, it is shorthand for $\ColMod{N}{A}{8}$ where $A = \{a\}$. Note this notation only allows for a singleton set $A$, so when we list multiple variants, like Collatz Variants, 1, 5, and 7, we mean the three variants $\ColMod{N}{\{1\}}{8}$, $\ColMod{N}{\{5\}}{8}$, and $\ColMod{N}{\{7\}}{8}$. 
    \item \textbf{Collatz Variant $\boldsymbol{\{a_1,a_2\}}$:} A Collatz Variant with a set of 2 or larger elements in $A$ will always use set notation. Example: Collatz Variant $\{5,7\}$ means $\ColMod{N}{\{5,7\}}{8}$.
    \item \textbf{Collatz String Rewrite System(SRS):} Created by Aaronson~\ref{HeuleAaronson}, and introduced in chapter~\ref{sec:SRSandSAT}, along with background of string rewrite systems, this is used in the latter portion of this paper as an alternative way of expressing the Collatz Conjecture.
    \item \textbf{Collatz Subproblem:} Modifying the rewrite rules in the Collatz SRS by modifying/removing certain rules. This is used in chapter~\ref{sec:hardnessrewriterules} to explore modifications of the Collatz SRS that are akin to Collatz Variants.
    \item \textbf{Number of bits:} For an input number $x$, we say that, written in binary, it has $m$ bits.
